# World-Holiday-Search-Engine

I'd be glad to craft a comprehensive README.md description for your World-Holiday-Search-Engine project on GitHub, incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project is a web application designed to empower users to explore holidays celebrated around the world. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it provides a user-friendly interface for searching holidays based on various criteria.

Features:
Global Holiday Search: Search for holidays by country, year (optional), and month (optional) to discover diverse cultural celebrations.
Informative Results: Display detailed information about the retrieved holidays, including their names, descriptions, and potentially dates and customs (depending on data source).

Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the core structure and content of the web application.
CSS: Defines the visual styles, layout, and responsiveness of the user interface.
JavaScript: Enables dynamic interactions, data manipulation, and potentially API integration to retrieve holiday information.

Additional Notes:
API Integration (Optional): If you plan to use an external API to fetch holiday data, you'll need to create an account on the API provider's platform and obtain an API key. Store the API key securely using environment variables or a configuration file.
Data Source: Briefly mention the data source for holidays, whether it's a local dataset, an external API, or a combination of both.
Project Structure: Provide a high-level overview of the project directory structure (e.g., HTML files for the user interface, CSS files for styles, JavaScript files for logic, etc.).
Testing (Optional): If you've implemented automated testing, describe how to run the tests.
Contribution Guidelines (Optional): If you welcome contributions, outline your contribution process (e.g., forking, pull requests, code style conventions).
